![IBM watsonx.ai](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/watson-machine-learning-samples/master/cloud/notebooks/headers/watsonx-Prompt_Lab-Notebook.png)

## Overview

**Interview Trainer Agent** is an AI-powered, interactive mock interview solution built entirely in IBM Cloud watsonx.ai Studio. This repository contains all notebooks, assets, and resources needed to deploy, customize, and use the agent for automated interview practice and evaluation.

The project leverages IBM's watsonx.ai platform for prompt engineering, large language model integration, and seamless cloud execution, providing users with an intelligent, scalable, and cost-effective way to prepare for interviews.

   git clone https://github.com/Raj17deep/Interview-Trainer-Agent-IBM-Cloud.git
   ```

2. **Open IBM Cloud watsonx.ai Studio:**
   - Create/open a project.
   - Upload the provided notebooks and assets.

3. **Run the Notebooks in Sequence:**
   - Start with `Interview Agent Deployment code.ipynb` to set up the environment.
   - Proceed to `Interview Trainer Agent code.ipynb` to start using the agent.

4. **(Optional) Update Knowledge Base:**
   - Edit the knowledge base PDF or notebook cells to add/remove questions.

5. **Test & Customize:**
   - Run mock interviews, analyze feedback, and tune prompts as needed.
